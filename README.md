## Introduction

<p>Collusion is an turn-based, interactive three player game. The concept is similar to "Capture the Flag" game. In the Collusion, instead of having multiple flags for every team, we have a single flag placed in the center of the three grides.</p>

**Each turn player can:**
* Reveal the closest bomb placed in one of the other player's region(If any)
* Place a bomb on in one of the other player's region
* Move own agent 1 space forward or diagonal

**Rules:**
* At max one bomb per row can be placed.
* If you hit a bomb, that position is revealed to the player and the agent is moved to its most recent previous position. 
* If you reveal a bomb to a player, they cant bomb you for one full turn-cycle.
* If you place a bomb on a bomb, it still acts as single bomb placed.

**Win condition:**
* First player to reach the flag wins.
